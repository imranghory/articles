# Companies Recruiting at Silicon Milkroundabout (12th May 2013) By Technology Stack #

[Silicon Milkroundabout](http://siliconmilkroundabout.com/) doesn't breakdown companies by what they're hiring for so it makes it hard for say Python developers to find companies hiring for Python. So  I made this list which organizes them by what technologies they're hiring for to help solve that problem.

Based upon looking at the websites of the individual companies, about a third of the websites didn't have enough information to figure out what the companies were hiring for so I haven't included them here. Feel free to send me any corrections to (imranghory@gmail.com)
